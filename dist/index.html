  <p> In 2004,I graduated from Olabisi Onabanjo University Ogun State Nigeria with Bsc.Banking and finance but my passion for Programming and cybersecurity  is unconditional and I have always had a keen interest in knowing what is happening in the Information technology business environment as a whole;that is why I have decided to apply for Code your future because i want to do career in this field and i am pretty sure that this program will equip me with lot of tools and skills required to do so;through this program i will have the chance to sink into the world of economy and profit of the high demand that is there currently for the IT graduates in the job market.

  I believe that my personal attributes,academic achievements and relevant work experience make me a suitable candidate for the course. As far as my personal experiences are concerned,they taught me to have patience,self emotion control as well as realize the importance of listening,respecting the opinions of others and the significance of being versatile.

I am a person who is always ready to or on a go to participate to take part in students and community events and I believe through that way I can contribute in my way in creating and promoting a healthy and better student environment.

In problem solving situations,I have a tireless eye for details and analyze the problem through several techniques before making any important decision.
